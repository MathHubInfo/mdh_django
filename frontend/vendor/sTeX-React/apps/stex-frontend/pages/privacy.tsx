          <h2>Storing of IP Addresses</h2>
          <p>
            Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We use information
            that we receive and store during your visit to our website
            exclusively for internal purposes and to improve the design of the
            website, including sub-pages.
            <br />
            <br />
            If necessary for the purpose of defending against attacks that
            impair the functionality of our website (hacker attacks, malware,
            denial of service attacks, spam), we may access your computer&apos;s
            IP address for this purpose alone. The legal basis for this
            processing is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.
          </p>
          <h2>Usage Information &amp; Statistical Data</h2>
          <p>
            The system will collect personalized data on all of your
            interactions with the system, including
            click/hover/mouse-movement-streams, page requests, results of
            quizzes, etc. The system uses this data to generate learning
            competency models that in turn affect the generated course materials
            and the interaction with the system.
            <br />
            <br />
            These personalized data will only be accessible to agents that are
            authenticated with your personal IDM credentials. In particular, no
            personal data will be transmitted outside the system without your
            consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            The VoLL-KI research project will use this data in aggregated,
            anonymized, and/or pseudonymized form to evaluate the system and the
            underlying methods. We will use best professional effort to make
            sure that personalized data cannot be re-engineered from aggregated
            data.
          </p>
          <h2>Your Rights as a Website User</h2>
          When it comes to processing your personal data, the GDPR grants you
          certain rights as a website user:
          <br />
          <h3>Right of Access (Art. 15 of the GDPR):</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request confirmation as to whether personal
            data concerning you is being processed; where this is the case, you
            have a right of access to this personal data and to the information
            specified in Article 15 of the GDPR.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Right to Rectification and Right to Erasure (Art. 16 and 17 of the
            GDPR):
          </h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to immediately request the rectification of
            incorrect personal data concerning you and, if necessary, the
            completion of incomplete personal data.
            <br />
            <br />
            You also have the right to request that personal data concerning you
            be erased immediately if one of the reasons listed in Art. 17 of the
            GDPR applies in detail, e.g. if the data is no longer required for
            the purposes for which it was collected.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR):</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request a restriction of processing for the
            duration of a review if any of the conditions specified in Art. 18
            of the GDPR have been met, e.g. if you have lodged an objection to
            the processing.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to Data Portability (Art. 20 of the GDPR):</h3>
          <p>
            In certain cases (which are outlined in detail in Article 20 of the
            GDPR), you have the right to obtain from us your personal data in a
            structured, standard, machine-readable format or to request the
            transfer of such data to a third party.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to Object (Art. 21 of the GDPR):</h3>
          <p>
            If data is collected on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (data
            processing on the grounds of legitimate interests), you have the
            right to object to the processing at any time for reasons arising
            from your particular situation. If you make such an objection, we
            will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate
            compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
            interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise,
            or defense of legal claims.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority:</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with Art. 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge
            a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that the
            processing of your personal data violates data protection
            regulations. This right to lodge a complaint may particularly be
            exercised before a supervisory authority in the EU member state
            where you reside, work, or where you suspect that your rights have
            been infringed.
          </p>

            In the future, we may need to change these policies. These may be,
            but are not limited to, the following:
            <ul>
              <li>we decide to add a new feature to an existing service</li>

              <li>we may decide to offer an additional service.</li>

            rights as a data subject, we will notify you of these changes in
            advance.
            <br />
            <br />

            possible.
